# docker-altuscli

This builds an easy to use docker image containing the latest altuscli pulled from the upstream PIP repository.

See Dockerfile for instructions on how to build the image, configure your altus credentials, and how to run the altus command line.

# Notes:

This was tested on Docker for Mac using build 17.05.0-ce-rc1-mac8 (16582). If you run into problems, check that you're running _atleast_ that version.
